| MODULE COMARQUAGE  v1.0           Author: intessit           23/04/2007   |

How it works :
--------------

This module take information on a remote webserver (service-public.fr) and display content in page
It's allow to have administration information without going on their website.
Data are provided in many xml files. Thoses file are downloaded on remote server and, if needed,
a cache is done locally to avoid remote request each ask.
There are some xsl files which transform xml into html and display content in page.


How to setup :
--------------

Do all these steps before accessing page in frontoffice !

 - Put the block Co-marquage in a page
   - Define cache time in hours (0 = no cache)
   - Define city (Commune) : Write whole city name (all space will be converted by dash [-])
       by example : write : Villeneuve la Garenne, data saved will be : Villeneuve-la-Garenne
   - Define department (Departement) : Write whole department name (all space will be converted by dash [-])
       by example : write : Hauts de Seine, data saved will be : Hauts-de-Seine
       If you write directly : Hauts-de-Seine, it won't be changed
     (@info : next version will certainly have another way to set these values, but for now it's like that :)
   - You can delete config file, the file will be created at the first visit in frontoffice
   - You can force to delete all cached files
 - Tag the page with 'Page de Co-marquage' tag
 - Define constant COMARQUAGE_XML_URL to the url of xml source if different of 'http://lecomarquage.service-public.fr/xml2/'
 - If you override xsl update path from 'xsl-params.xsl' in the xsl file
     - path in original module : <xsl:include href="../../../cache/xsl-params.xsl"/>
     - path in overrided webapp module : <xsl:include href="../../../../cache/xsl-params.xsl"/>
     
 => You can access co-marquage page in frontoffice

After that, you will have to change css for each customer by overriding frontoffice.xml file


BE CAREFUL :
------------

When you use pear package ! Each project must create a file called xsl-params.xsl in xsl folder
So if there is no pear repository for each project, override xsl folder in webapp !
or all project will have same config file ! and there will be a problem soon...


If any error occurs :
---------------------

Each time there is an error, an friendly error is displayed on frontoffice
Each error is logged (error or fatal log), you can know exactly what failed
